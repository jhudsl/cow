### gitHelpeR

This is very much under construction. But here's some of things it does so far (documentation is forthcoming): 

- Checks if a repository exists in GitHub
- Retrieves all the GitHub public repositories and all the GitHub pages for a given GitHub organization
- Retrieves all the chapter names for all the bookdowns for all the GitHub pages for a given GitHub organization.
